Goal
The user wants to find the value of the Ideal Weight.
Scope
Health Calculator System
Level
User Goal
Stakeholders and Interests
User: Wants to compute his ideal weight based on his height and his gender as input variables.
Health Calculator System: Ensures valid input values and provides accurate calculations.
Developers of the system: Ensure the system handles different inputs correctly and provides useful error messages.
Preconditions
The user must provide a valid height in centimeters.
The user must specify gender as either 'm' (male) or 'w' (female).
Minimal Guarantees
The system does not crash and handles correctly invalid inputs.
Error messages are provided for invalid height or gender values in order to understand the issue.
Success Guarantee
The system successfully computes and returns the ideal weight for the given height and gender.
Trigger 
The user decide to compute the Ideal weight.
Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)
1. The user inputs their height in centimeters.
2. The user gives in input the gender ('m' for male, 'w' for female).
3. The system verifies that the height is a positive number and that is at least 84 cm for men and at least 67 cm for women, which are the minimum height requirements.
4. The system calculates the ideal weight using the correct formula:
5. For men: idealWeight = height - 100 - (height - 150) / 4
6. For women: idealWeight = height - 100 - (height - 150) / 2.5
7. The system displays the ideal weight to the user.
Alternative Scenarios
3.a The system checks and the height value is invalid.
3.a.1 The system discover that the value of the height received in input by the user is not valid.
3.a.2 The system warns the user about the problem showing a message InvalidHeightException.
3.a.3 The system ask again the user to insert the input. Goes back to step 1.

3.b The system checks and the gender value is invalid.
3.b.1 The system discover that the value of the gender received in input by the user is not valid.
3.b.2 The system warns the user about the problem showing a message InvalidGenderException.
3.b.3 The system ask again the user to insert the input. Goes back to step 2.
